# EggTimer

Egg timer is a timer for boiling eggs. In the application, you can select one of the cooking modes using a swipe and start the timer. After the start button, the countdown begins.
At the same time, the image on the main screen changes. 
When the timer expires, it gives a notification along with a sound signal (even if the device is locked).
